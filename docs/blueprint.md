## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to create a sense of trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), very close in hue to the primary.
- Accent color: Green (#4CAF50) for a sense of progress.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear, readable text throughout the app.
- Use simple, clear icons for the bottom navigation bar and within the task listings.
- Design for a mobile screen (360px width) with rounded corners, soft shadows, and large, easily tappable buttons.
- Use subtle animations for task completion and page transitions.
